# To Do

## Hotfixes

* one-point side-cond has to be  x-bar notin *e-bar*
* match fails with ∀\_one\_point in proof of ∃\_one\_point

## Quantifier Laws in proofs

* need to handle side-conditions
* need to classify matches (whole, lhs, rhs, etc...)

## Theory Managmement

* law renaming
* Generating proof graph as dot/graphviz file.
