# To Do

## Hotfixes

1. Why can't law '¬_subst' be found using "m ¬_subst" ?
   cause 1 : in PredExists proof, PropSubst is not in scope

## Quantifier Laws in proofs

1. need to show goal side-condition on each line
2. need to handle side-conditions
3. need to classify matches (whole, lhs, rhs, etc...)
4. law renaming
5. Generating proof graph as dot/graphviz file?
