# To Do

## Hotfixes

## Next Task(s)

* **Confusion Alert!** The use of "binding" for the outcome of matching gets confused with the notion of "binding" and "bound" associated with various quantifiers. Perhaps we should reconsider re-naming `Binding.Binding`, etc to `?.Mapping` ? or `MMapping` ? or `MMap` ?

 
* LiveProof returns `(bind,local_scC)` - need to get `local_scC` into proof step.


* make proof loading more tolerant of read/show mismatches - allow a step to be marked as TBR (to-be-redone).

## Quantifier Laws in proofs

## Theory Management

* law renaming

* Generating proof graph as dot/graphviz file.
