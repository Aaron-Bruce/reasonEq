# To Do

## Hotfixes

## Next Task(s)

* figure out where side-condition checking should be done
  * in `simpleMatch` in `LiveProofs` 
* implement side-cond instantiation.
* make proof loading more tolerant of read/show mismatches - allow a step to be marked as TBR (to-be-redone).
* instantiate side-conditions in matches
* handle side-conditions (just `Disjoint` for now)

## Quantifier Laws in proofs

## Theory Management

* law renaming
* Generating proof graph as dot/graphviz file.
