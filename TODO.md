# To Do



## Hotfixes

### `PredUniv` Proofs

In `univ_False` proof,

we can `tm 2 exists_inst` on focus `(∃ x̅ • true)`
and get a match, but `m exists_inst` or just `m`
fail to return a match (is 20 too short?).

'20' matches a settable parameter (`maxMatchDisplay`).

(However setting it to 40 in `Main.lhs` and `Dev.lhs` has no effect!)

Need to reach stage where proofs work.

Proof of `[]_idem` stalls on `(∀ x̅ • (∀ x̅ • P))`.


### Instantiating Side-Conditions

`instantiateASC` is just wrong - it's acting more like discharge should.
Also, `Disjoint` and `IsPre` distribute conjunctively through set union (of sets formed when `vs` and `gv` get instantiated)
However, assume we have `Covers x$ P` where `x$` is mapped to `{a,b,c$}` and `P` to `Q /\ x=1 \/ R` (say).
This cannot be broken down into a conjuction of conditions relating
each of `a`, `b`, and `c$` individually to each of `Q`, `{x}`,
and `R`, also taken individually.
Instead we have to assert that `{a,b} U c$` covers `Q U {x} U R`.

### Unique quantified variables

We need to either have unique q.v.s, or be very careful. Consider matching `[∀ x$ @ P]`  against `[P]` (part 1 of `[]_def`). How do we distinguish this `x$` from the one in the law?

Need care here - in the conjecture
 `(∃ x̅,y̅ • ∧(x̅=e̅)∧P)≡(∃ y̅ • P[e̅/x̅])  x̅ ∉ e̅` 
we need `x̅` and `y̅` to be the same.

What we want to avoid is "shadowing", 
so that `(∀ x̅ • P ∨ (∀ x̅ • Q)`
becomes `(∀ x̅ • P ∨ (∀ y̅ • Q[y̅/x̅])`.

## Next Task(s)

 
* LiveProof returns `(bind,local_scC)` - need to get `local_scC` into proof step.


* make proof loading more tolerant of read/show mismatches - allow a step to be marked as TBR (to-be-redone).

## Quantifier Laws in proofs

## Theory Management

* law renaming

* Generating proof graph as dot/graphviz file.
