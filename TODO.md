# To Do

## Hotfixes

Need to redefine bindings for substitution matches - see below.

## Next Task(s)

* add facility to save laws/conjectures as conjectures in specific files
* add facility to load from a conjecture file into a theory, either as conjectures, or laws, or a mix of both (these two features are designed (i) to minimise the proof rework in the event of a proof (or even term) datatype change, and (ii) to allow the easy introduction of (derived?) axioms for theory prototyping.
* make proof loading more tolerant of read/show mismatches - allow a step to be marked as TBR (to-be-redone).
* instantiate side-conditions in matches
* handle side-conditions (just `Disjoint` for now)

## Quantifier Laws in proofs

## Theory Management

* law renaming
* Generating proof graph as dot/graphviz file.
