# To Do

## Hotfixes

## Quantifier Laws in proofs

* need to simplify side-conditions (drastically)
* need to re-instate side-condition tests
* need to handle side-conditions (just `Disjoint` for now)
* need to classify matches (whole, lhs, rhs, etc...)

## Theory Management

* law renaming
* Generating proof graph as dot/graphviz file.
