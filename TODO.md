# To Do

## Hotfixes

Need to redefine bindings for substitution matches - see below.

## Next Task(s)

* Substitution matchings involving listvar/listvar pairs should produce a binding from such a pair  to a pair of sets, one of term/var pairs, the other of listvar/listvar pairs.
* instantiate side-conditions in matches
* handle side-conditions (just `Disjoint` for now)

## Quantifier Laws in proofs

## Theory Management

* law renaming
* Generating proof graph as dot/graphviz file.
